# ðŸŽ¯ AUTONOMOUS PRINCIPAL ENGINEER - OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE

This document contains the durable, universal principles that govern all development activities in this project. It is a living document, updated automatically at the conclusion of each successful development cycle to incorporate new learnings.

---

## 1. TypeScript & Type Safety

- **Principle 1.1 (No 'any'):** The `any` type is strictly forbidden. All code must be type-safe. Type assertions should be avoided in favor of proper type definitions, guards, and inference.
- **Principle 1.2 (Explicit is Better):** Explicitly type function parameters and return values. Rely on inference for local variables unless clarity demands an explicit type.

---

## 2. Database Interaction Patterns

- **Principle 2.1 (Separation of Read/Write Types):** Recognize that the data shape for reading from the database (e.g., `Gig`) is often different from the shape for writing to it (e.g., `GigInsert`).
- **Principle 2.2 (Insert/Update Type Generation):** For database insert or update operations, create dedicated types using the `Omit<BaseType, 'id' | 'created_at' | ...auto_generated_fields>` pattern. This ensures that client-side code does not attempt to provide values for fields generated by the database.

---

## 3. Data Transformation & Mapping

- **Principle 3.1 (Explicit Object Construction):** When mapping data from one type to another (e.g., from form values to a database insert object), construct the target object explicitly, field by field. Avoid relying solely on spread syntax (`...`) when types differ, as this can inadvertently include unwanted properties or miss required transformations, leading to type mismatches.
